## Encapsulation

* We use encapsulation if we want this value assignment to pass certain conditions while assigning an external value to any feature in the class.
* We can do this in the get and set parts of the property.

* Set=> is activated when an external value is assigned to the property.
* Get=> It is activated when we want to see the value in the property.

## Read Only
* If you remove the set part from a property, it cannot be assigned a value from outside. In this case, he will bring back whatever was asked to be returned.
