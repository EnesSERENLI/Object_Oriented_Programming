## Abstraction

Abstraction is an OOP concept that "shows" only essential attributes and "hides" unnecessary information in applications.

* Abstract classes are only meant to inherit.
* An instance cannot be taken from a class defined as Abstract.
* Abstract methods are only used in abstract classes.
* Abstract methods cannot be defined as virtual. They must be crushed.
* Abstract methods do not have a body. They don't have scopes.
* Abstract classes cannot be defined as static.
