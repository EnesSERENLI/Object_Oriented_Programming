## Interface

* Properties or methods defined in an Interface cannot have access tokens.
* Interfaces are models created for types such as classes. They are templates that determine which members a class will consist of. In this way, they lead the classes to be created.
* It is mandatory to use the properties or methods defined in it.
* They bring talent to the classes
* An instance cannot be taken from the class defined as Interface.
* A class can inherit multiple interfaces. Likewise, an interface can be inherited from more than one class.
